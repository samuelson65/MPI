Guideline ID Clinical Category Guideline Name Logic (The "IF" Statement) Insight & Audit Idea (The "THEN" Statement)
CHF-001 Cardiology (CHF) Probable "Wet" Discharge (index drg IN [CHF_DRGs]) AND (readm drg IN [CHF_DRGs]) AND (index claim los < [gmlos_lookup]) AND (daysgap <= 7) Insight: Classic premature discharge. The patient was likely still fluid-overloaded. Audit Idea: Order the record. Review final 24-hr vitals (tachycardia?), I/Os (Intake/Output), and daily weights (was weight stable or increasing?). Look for nursing notes of "pedal edema" or "crackles."
CHF-002 Cardiology (CHF) Failed Handoff (CHF) (index drg IN [CHF_DRGs]) AND (Discharge_Disposition = '01' [Home]) AND (daysgap <= 3) Insight: Extremely rapid "bounce-back" after discharge to home. This signals a critical failure in the handoff. Audit Idea: Order Case Management notes. Look for a lack of a scheduled PCP/Cardiology follow-up and no documented "teach-back"* on the patient's new diuretic plan and low-sodium diet.
CHF-003 Cardiology (CHF) Renal Complication (index drg IN [CHF_DRGs]) AND (readm drg IN [Renal_Failure_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 7) Insight: Aggressive diuresis for CHF may have caused acute kidney injury (AKI). This is a known, foreseeable complication. Audit Idea: Order the record. Review labs from the index stay. Was the patient's Creatinine/BUN already rising before discharge? If so, this was an unstable, foreseeable event.
CHF-004 Cardiology (CHF) Over-Medication / Hypotension (index drg IN [CHF_or_HTN_DRGs]) AND (readm drg IN [Syncope_Fall_Hypotension_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 10) Insight: The patient was likely started on or titrated up on new BP/heart meds (e.g., ACE-I, Beta-Blockers) and became hypotensive at home. Audit Idea: Order the record. Review med reconciliation. Was a new, high-risk med started? Was there any patient education on monitoring for dizziness?
AMI-001 Cardiology (AMI) Failed Med Handoff (DAPT) (index drg IN [AMI_or_PCI_DRGs]) AND (readm drg IN [AMI_or_Stent_Thrombosis_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 30) Insight: This is a critical failure of education. Stent thrombosis is often due to non-adherence to Dual Anti-Platelet Therapy (DAPT). Audit Idea: Order Case Management & Pharmacy notes. Look for explicit documentation that the patient was educated on the life-threatening risk of stopping their Plavix/Brilinta and that they received the prescription.
AMI-002 Cardiology (AMI) Post-PCI Complication (Bleed) (index drg IN [PCI_DRGs]) AND (readm drg IN [Bleeding_or_Vascular_Comp_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 3) Insight: Direct complication from the procedure (e.g., retroperitoneal bleed, access site hematoma). Audit Idea: Order the record. Review post-procedure nursing notes. Were there any notes of new hematoma, severe back/flank pain, or unstable BP before discharge?
AMI-003 Cardiology (AMI) Post-AMI Heart Failure (index drg IN [AMI_DRGs]) AND (readm drg IN [CHF_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 10) Insight: A very common complication of AMI (a weakened heart). The discharge plan must anticipate this. Audit Idea: Order the record. Review the final Echocardiogram (was LVEF very low?) and discharge meds. Was the patient started on guideline-directed medical therapy (e.g., beta-blockers) before discharge?
PNA-001 Pulmonology (PNA) Unstable Discharge (Vitals) (index drg IN [PNA_DRGs]) AND (readm drg IN [PNA_or_Sepsis_DRGs]) AND (index claim los < [gmlos_lookup]) AND (daysgap <= 5) Insight: Classic premature discharge. The infection was likely not resolved. Audit Idea: Order the record. Go directly to the 24-hr vital signs flow sheet. Look for fever (>100.4F), high respiratory rate (>24), or O2 sat <92% on room air. Also, check if they were still receiving IV antibiotics.
PNA-002 Pulmonology (PNA) Unsafe Handoff (Weakness) (index drg IN [PNA_DRGs]) AND (readm drg IN [Dehydration_or_Altered_Mental_DRGs]) AND (Discharge_Disposition = '01' [Home]) AND (daysgap <= 5) Insight: Patient (often elderly) was discharged home too weak to care for themselves. This is a functional, not a medical, failure. Audit Idea: Order Physical Therapy & Case Management notes. Did PT clear the patient for "independent ambulation"? Did CM document a "safe home environment" and "family support available"? If not, this was an unsafe discharge.
COPD-001 Pulmonology (COPD) Failed Education (Action Plan) (index drg IN [COPD_DRGs]) AND (readm drg IN [COPD_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 15) Insight: The patient did not understand how to manage their condition at home. This is a primary failure of education. Audit Idea: Order Case Management & Respiratory Therapy notes. Look for documented, specific education on: 1) Inhaler technique ("teach-back" method) and 2) A written "COPD Action Plan" (Green/Yellow/Red zones). Its absence is the core of your audit.
COPD-002 Pulmonology (COPD) Failed Handoff (Home O2) (index drg IN [COPD_DRGs]) AND (Discharge_Disposition = '06' [Home w/ Home Health]) AND (daysgap <= 3) Insight: This signals a critical failure in coordinating the home care plan. The patient likely went without O2. Audit Idea: Order Case Management notes. Look for confirmation that the Home Oxygen company accepted the patient and delivered the equipment. "Referral sent to home O2" is not enough—it must be a confirmed handoff.
SURG-001 Surgical (General) Surgical Site Infection (SSI) (index drg IN [Major_Surgery_DRGs_eg_Ortho_Colon]) AND (readm drg IN [SSI_Sepsis_or_Wound_Dehiscence_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 30) Insight: The #1 preventable surgical readmission. This is a direct, related complication. Audit Idea: Order the record. Review discharge notes. Was the patient given clear, written instructions on wound care and the specific signs of infection (fever, redness, pus) to report?
SURG-002 Surgical (GI) Anastomotic Leak (index drg IN [Bowel_Resection_Gastric_Bypass_DRGs]) AND (readm drg IN [Sepsis_Abscess_or_Peritonitis_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 10) Insight: A dreaded, but known, complication. Patient may have had subtle signs of this before discharge. Audit Idea: Order the record. Review the final 48-hr vitals & labs. Look for any low-grade fever, persistent tachycardia, or rising WBC count that was dismissed as "normal post-op."
SURG-003 Surgical (General) Post-op DVT / PE (index drg IN [Major_Surgery_DRGs_eg_Ortho_Gyn_Abdo]) AND (readm drg IN [DVT_or_Pulmonary_Embolism_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 30) Insight: Failure of post-operative prophylaxis (blood thinners). Audit Idea: Order the index stay's Medication Administration Record (MAR). Was the patient receiving chemical prophylaxis (e.g., Lovenox, Heparin)? If not, was there a documented contraindication? Were they prescribed prophylaxis to take home?
SURG-004 Surgical (General) Post-op Ileus / Obstruction (index drg IN [GI_Surgery_DRGs_eg_Bowel_Resection]) AND (readm drg IN [Ileus_Obstruction_or_Vomiting_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 7) Insight: Premature discharge before bowel function ("flatus" or "BM") fully returned. Audit Idea: Order the record. Review nursing notes for the last 24-48 hrs. Was the patient tolerating a solid diet? Were they having bowel movements (BMs) and passing flatus? If not, they failed a basic discharge criterion.
SURG-005 Surgical (Spine/Ortho) Post-op Urinary Retention (index drg IN [Major_Surgery_esp_Spinal_Ortho_DRGs]) AND (readm drg IN [UTI_or_Urinary_Retention_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 3) Insight: Patient (especially male) discharged without a successful "voiding trial" after their Foley catheter was removed. Audit Idea: Check nursing notes. Did the patient void successfully and have a "bladder scan" to check for residual urine before discharge?
ORTHO-001 Orthopedics (TKA/THA) Prosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) (index drg IN [TKA_THA_DRGs]) AND (readm drg IN [Infection_Sepsis_PJI_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 30) Insight: This is a high-cost, severe complication. The readmission is a direct consequence of the index procedure. Audit Idea: Order the record. Review index Op Note (long procedure time? contamination?), post-op vitals (any low-grade fevers?), and discharge wound care instructions. Was education on infection signs clear?
ORTHO-002 Orthopedics (TKA/THA) SNF Bounce-Back (Pain/Rehab) (index drg IN [TKA_THA_DRGs]) AND (Discharge_Disposition = '03' [To SNF]) AND (readm drg IN [Uncontrolled_Pain_Failure_to_Rehab_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 5) Insight: The SNF rejected the patient as unable to participate in rehab. The hospital's discharge pain plan was inadequate. Audit Idea: Order CM notes and the SNF transfer packet. Review the discharge pain med orders. Was the patient's pain controlled on oral meds for 24-48 hours before transfer?
ORTHO-003 Orthopedics (THA) Hip Dislocation (index drg IN [THA_DRGs]) AND (readm drg IN [Dislocation_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 30) Insight: This is a 100% failure of patient education or post-op positioning. Audit Idea: Order PT and CM notes. Look for explicit, documented "teach-back"* that the patient/family understood "hip precautions" (e.g., no bending > 90 degrees, no crossing legs).
ORTHO-004 Orthopedics (Spine) Failed Spine Surgery (Pain) (index drg IN [Spinal_Fusion_Laminectomy_DRGs]) AND (readm drg IN [Uncontrolled_Pain_Radiculopathy_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 10) Insight: The patient's pain was not adequately managed, or the surgery failed. Audit Idea: Review discharge med plan. Was a multimodal pain plan (e.g., nerve meds, muscle relaxers, not just narcotics) in place? Was a follow-up with the surgeon scheduled?
WOUND-001 Debridement / Wound Failed Debridement / Progression (index drg IN [Debridement_DRGs]) AND (readm drg IN [Sepsis_Osteomyelitis_or_Amputation_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 15) Insight: The initial debridement failed to control the infection source. This is a continuation of the first stay. Audit Idea: Order index Op Note. Was the debridement described as "to clean margins"? Review index cultures vs. readmit cultures. Was the discharge antibiotic plan appropriate for the bug?
WOUND-002 Debridement / Wound Failed Home Care (Wound VAC) (index drg IN [Complex_Wound_DRGs]) AND (Discharge_Disposition = '06' [Home Health]) AND (readm drg IN [Infection_Sepsis_Wound_Comp_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 7) Insight: Critical failure in coordinating complex home care. The Wound VAC may have failed or the HH nurse was not set up. Audit Idea: Order Case Management notes. Look for confirmation that the Wound VAC company and the HH agency accepted the patient and scheduled the first visit. "Referral sent" is not sufficient.

NEURO-001 Neurological (Stroke) Post-Stroke Complication (index drg IN [Stroke_CVA_DRGs]) AND (readm drg IN [Aspiration_PNA_or_UTI_or_Fall_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 15) Insight: These are 100% discharge-planning failures. The patient's new functional/cognitive deficits were not properly managed. Audit Idea: Order PT, OT, and Speech Therapy notes. Was a swallow study done? Was the patient cleared for their diet? Was the discharge plan (e.g., to SNF) appropriate and was it followed?
NEURO-002 Neurological Seizure Med Failure (index drg IN [Seizure_DRGs]) AND (readm drg IN [Seizure_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 10) Insight: Sub-therapeutic medication or patient non-compliance due to failed education. Audit Idea: Check discharge notes. Was a level drawn for their anti-epileptic drug (e.g., Dilantin, Keppra)? Was explicit education provided on med adherence? Was a follow-up with Neurology scheduled?
NEURO-003 Neurological Post-op Delirium (index drg IN [Major_Surgery_esp_Ortho_Cardiac_DRGs]) AND (readm drg IN [Altered_Mental_Status_Delirium_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 5) Insight: Patient (often elderly) was discharged while still delirious ("sundowning"). This is a huge patient safety failure. Audit Idea: Review nursing notes for the last 24-48 hrs for words like "confused," "agitated," "picking at lines," or "sundowning." Was a delirium screen (e.g., CAM-ICU) documented as negative?
GI-001 GI / Infectious C. Difficile (Acquired) (index drg IN [ANY_DRG_with_long_LOS_or_Antibiotics]) AND (readm drg IN [C_Difficile_Colitis_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 30) Insight: This is a hospital-acquired infection (HAI), often caused by the antibiotics from the first stay. Audit Idea: Review index MAR. What antibiotics were they on and for how long? Was the use of antibiotics appropriate? This is a strong case for a hospital-acquired condition.
GI-002 GI / Procedural Post-Procedural Complication (index drg IN [EGD_ERCP_DRGs]) AND (readm drg IN [Pancreatitis_Bleeding_or_Perforation_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 2) Insight: Direct, known procedural complication. The patient may have been discharged too soon from post-procedure recovery (PACU). Audit Idea: Review procedure note and post-procedure monitoring. Was there any abdominal pain, unstable vitals, or fever before discharge?
PROC-001 Procedural (Device) Pacemaker/ICD Failure (index drg IN [PPM_ICD_Implant_DRGs]) AND (readm drg IN [Lead_Dislodgement_Device_Malfunction_or_Infection_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 30) Insight: Procedural complication or failed education. Audit Idea: Review device interrogation reports. Review discharge education. Was the patient explicitly educated on arm movement restrictions (e.g., "do not lift elbow above shoulder") to prevent lead dislodgement?
PROC-002 Procedural (GI) PEG Tube Failure (index drg IN [PEG_Placement_DRGs]) AND (readm drg IN [Aspiration_PNA_Infection_Tube_Dislodged_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 15) Insight: Failure of education or placement. The readmission is a direct consequence of the new device. Audit Idea: Order CM notes. Was the caregiver (family or SNF) trained on tube feeds and site care before discharge? Was a post-placement KUB film checked for correct placement?
MED-001 High-Risk Meds Anticoagulation (Warfarin) Failure (index drg IN [ANY_DRG]) AND (Patient_on_Warfarin) AND (readm drg IN [Bleeding_GI_Bleed_or_Clotting_Stroke_DVT_PE_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 10) Insight: A high-risk medication handoff failure. The patient's INR was either sub-therapeutic (clot) or supra-therapeutic (bleed). Audit Idea: Order CM/Pharmacy notes. Was a clear "bridge plan" (if needed) documented? Was a specific follow-up appointment for an INR check within 3-5 days scheduled and confirmed?
MED-002 High-Risk Meds Insulin / Diabetes Mismanagement (index drg IN [ANY_DRG]) AND (Patient_has_Diabetes_Dx) AND (readm drg IN [Hyperglycemia_DKA_or_Hypoglycemia_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 7) Insight: The hospital changed the patient's diet, activity, or meds (e.g., added steroids) and failed to create a safe home insulin plan. Audit Idea: Order CM/Endo notes. Was a "Diabetes Educator" consulted? Was a clear, new home sliding scale or dosing plan documented and taught to the patient ("teach-back")?
VULN-001 Vulnerable Pop. (ESRD) Missed Dialysis Handoff (index drg IN [ANY_DRG]) AND (Patient_has_ESRD_Dx) AND (readm drg IN [CHF_Hyperkalemia_Fluid_Overload_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 3) Insight: This is a 100% preventable, system-level coordination failure. The patient missed their first post-discharge dialysis run. Audit Idea: Order Case Management notes. Look for confirmation that the outpatient dialysis center was contacted and the patient's first appointment was scheduled.
VULN-002 Vulnerable Pop. (Oncology) Neutropenic Fever (index drg IN [Chemo_DRGs_or_known_Cancer_Dx]) AND (readm drg IN [Neutropenia_Fever_Sepsis_DRGs]) AND (daysgap <= 15) Insight: An expected complication, but the discharge plan must be built to anticipate it. Audit Idea: Order CM notes. Was the patient explicitly educated on "neutropenic precautions" and when to call/return (e.g., "fever > 100.4")? Was a 24-hr oncology line provided?
SOCIAL-001 Social & Vague "Failure to Thrive" / "AMS" (index drg IN [ANY_DRG]) AND (readm drg IN [AMS_Failure_to_Thrive_Dehydration_DRGs]) AND (Discharge_Disposition = '01' [Home]) Insight: This is the ultimate "unsafe discharge." The patient was too weak/confused to be home. A goldmine for auditors. Audit Idea: Order Case Management, PT, and Nutrition notes. The plan was a demonstrable failure. Look for notes like "patient lives alone," "poor historian," or "no family support."
SOCIAL-002 Social Homelessness / Unsafe D/C (Discharge_Disposition = '65' [To Shelter/Homeless]) AND (daysgap <= 2) Insight: Patient had no safe place to go. This is a classic social determinant of health (SDOH) failure. Audit Idea: Order Case Management/Social Work notes. What plan was in place? Did they actually coordinate with a shelter, or just discharge to the street? This is a systemic failure.
SOCIAL-003 Social (Behavioral) Medical + Psych/Substance (index drg IN [Medical_DRG]) AND (readm drg IN [Psych_Substance_Abuse_DRGs]) Insight: Patient's co-morbid psych condition was not managed, leading to med non-compliance. Audit Idea: Order Social Work/Psych notes. Was a psych consult or follow-up ordered? Was this a "dual diagnosis" patient where the medical team ignored the psych needs, leading to the readmission?
HANDOFF-001 Handoff Failure SNF Bounce-Back (Unstable) (Discharge_Disposition = '03' [To SNF]) AND (daysgap <= 2) Insight: This is a critical failure. The Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) rejected the patient as unstable upon arrival. Audit Idea: Order the transfer summary notes and H&P. Did the hospital accurately represent the patient's condition? They likely transferred an unstable patient to a lower level of care.
HANDOFF-002 Handoff Failure Home Health Bounce-Back (Discharge_Disposition = '06' [To Home Health]) AND (daysgap <= 3) Insight: The Home Health agency found the patient unstable on the first visit ("Admission visit"). Audit Idea: Order Case Management notes. Was the HH referral confirmed? Did the HH agency's first-visit note document a condition (e.g., fever, "wet" CHF) that should have been managed in the hospital?
HANDOFF-003 Handoff Failure Failed Specialist Follow-up (index drg IN [Specialty_DRG_eg_Neurosurgery_Vascular]) AND (readm drg IN [related_DRG]) AND (daysgap > 7 AND daysgap <= 30) Insight: The patient never made it to their crucial specialist follow-up. Audit Idea: Order Case Management notes. Was a specific appointment scheduled? Or was it a vague "follow up with specialist in 2 weeks"? The latter is a failed, un-actionable discharge plan.
DEPRI-001 De-Prioritize Patient Non-Compliance (AMA) (Discharge_Disposition = '07' [Left AMA]) AND (daysgap <= 2) Insight: Patient left Against Medical Advice. Audit Idea: De-Prioritize or Filter Out. The hospital is protected if a signed AMA form is in the chart. This is a low-probability audit for you to win.
DEPRI-002 De-Prioritize Unrelated Traumatic Injury (index drg IN [ANY_Medical_DRG]) AND (readm drg IN [Trauma_Fracture_Fall_DRGs]) Insight: This is likely a new, unavoidable event. (Exception: See CHF-004. If the fall was caused by meds, it's relevant. If it was a car accident, it is not). Audit Idea: De-Prioritize. This is almost certainly an unrelated event.

Drug Code Intent (The Audit Concept) Logic (SQL / Python Rule) Citation / Reference Director Comments
J0178
(Eylea) Bilateral Anatomical Cap
Prevents billing >2 eyes per session. WHERE units > 2
(Logic: Humans only have 2 eyes. Max dose is 2mg/eye. 1 Unit = 1mg. Max Total = 2 units.) Regeneron Prescribing Info, Sec 2.2;
AAO Guidelines (Intravitreal Injection) High Volume Hit. Providers often bill the "Vial Size" (e.g., 4 units) instead of the administered dose (2 units). Instant denial.
J9271
(Keytruda) Max Flat Dose Ceiling
Stops claims exceeding the absolute FDA max/session. WHERE units > 400
(Logic: Max approved dose is 400mg Q6W. 1 Unit = 1mg.) FDA Label, Sec 2.1
(Recommended Dosage: 200mg or 400mg) The "Free Money" Audit. Fixed-dose drugs have zero variance. Any claim >400 is erroneous.
J9299
(Opdivo) Stratified Weight Outlier
Detects impossible weights based on Gender/BMI. CASE WHEN gender='F' AND (units/3.0) > 135 THEN 'FAIL'
(Trigger: Implied Weight > 99.7th %ile for Females) CDC Anthropometric Data (2015-2018);
BMS Label (3 mg/kg or Flat 240/480mg) Precision Strike. Don't use a generic 150kg limit. Using a female-specific limit (135kg) captures ~20% more errors.
J0897
(Prolia) Frequency Lock (6 Months)
Prevents early refills or double billing. WHERE days_since_last_claim < 150
(Logic: Dosed once every 6 months. Claims <5 months apart are duplicates or errors.) Amgen Prescribing Info, Sec 2.1
(60mg SQ every 6 months) Timing Audit. Providers often accidentally bill the same shot twice or schedule patients too early.
J2357
(Xolair) IgE / Weight Matrix Cap
Validates complex dosing grid. WHERE units > 600
(Logic: Max FDA dose is 600mg [4 vials] every 2 weeks, regardless of weight/IgE levels.) Genentech Dosing Table 1;
FDA Label (Max 600mg per session) Complexity Trap. The dosing table is confusing (Weight vs IgE). Providers often guess. The hard cap (600mg) is the safety net.
J9312
(Rituxan) BSA "Giant" Check
Implied Body Surface Area > 3.0 m^2. WHERE (units * 10 / 375) > 3.0
(Logic: Dosed at 375 mg/m². Implied BSA > 3.0 is statistically impossible.) Biogen Label (375 mg/m²);
Sacco et al. "Average BSA across US Population" Math Error Target. Providers often confuse 1 Unit = 10mg vs 1mg. This check catches the 10x coding errors.
J2506
(Neulasta) Impossible Wastage (Syringe)
Denies waste on single-dose forms. WHERE modifier = 'JW' AND units > 0
(Logic: Pre-filled 6mg syringe. You administer all or nothing. Waste is physically impossible.) CMS Manual Ch 17 Sec 40;
Amgen Label (Dosage Forms) Policy Enforcement. You cannot waste part of a pre-filled syringe. All JW claims here are invalid.
J2778
(Lucentis) Vial Size vs. Admin
Billing full vial volume vs. actual injection. WHERE units > 5
(Logic: Dose is 0.5mg [5 units]. Vial contains more for priming, but you only bill what enters the eye.) Genentech Label, Sec 2.2
(0.5 mg intravitreal injection) "Overfill" Abuse. Providers bill the "Overfill" left in the vial. Medicare pays for the dose, not the trash (unless Multi-Use).
J1745
(Remicade) Maintenance Phase Drift
High induction dose used in maintenance. WHERE units > 500 AND claim_count_6m > 3
(Logic: Dose drops from 5mg/kg to 3mg/kg after Week 6.) Janssen Label, Sec 2.1
(Induction vs Maintenance Dosing) Chronic Leakage. Patients stay on this drug for years. Ensure the dose drops down after the first 3 visits.
J9035
(Avastin) The "Obesity Paradox"
High weight asserted without ICD-10 code. WHERE implied_kg > 120 AND diag NOT LIKE '%E66%'
(Logic: If patient is >120kg, coding guidelines require Obesity Diagnosis.) ICD-10-CM Official Guidelines;
FDA Label (Weight-based dosing) Audit Trigger. If they claim the patient is huge to get paid more units, make them prove it with the diagnosis code.
J0585
(Botox) Migraine Unit Cap
Migraine protocol vs. cosmetic/muscle. WHERE diag LIKE 'G43%' AND units > 200
(Logic: FDA Max for Chronic Migraine is 155-195 Units. >200 is excessive.) Allergan Label, Sec 2.2
(Chronic Migraine: 155 Units) Off-Label Check. Prevents billing for "wasted" Botox or mixing cosmetic use with medical billing.
J9190
(5-FU) Multi-Day Date Span
Ensures "From" and "To" dates match units. WHERE units > 2000 AND (date_to - date_from) < 2
(Logic: 2000mg+ is a lethal daily dose. Must be spread over days.) FDA Label (Max Daily Dose 800mg);
NCCN Guidelines (Colon Cancer) Safety/Billing check. Forces providers to report the correct date span, which affects "Site of Service" payments.

ID Category Guideline Name Logic (Index → Readmit) 3 Distinct Audit Insights & Actionable Ideas Possibility & Feedback (What to look for in Notes)
1 Cardiology CHF Premature Discharge Index: CHF → Readmit: CHF 
(Gap ≤ 7 days) 1. Stability: Increasing weight/positive I/Os.
2. Meds: IV Lasix within 24h.
3. Signs: "2+ edema" or "crackles" at discharge. Possibility: Nursing notes might document "patient c/o SOB when walking to bathroom" on discharge day, contradicting the MD's "stable" note. Look for a discrepancy between the MD's "dry weight" goal and the actual discharge weight.
2 Cardiology CHF Medication Failure Index: CHF → Readmit: CHF 
(Gap 8-30 days) 1. Education: No "teach-back" on diet.
2. Access: Unfilled meds (cost).
3. Scale: Patient lacks home scale. Possibility: CM notes might mention "patient expressed concern about cost of Entresto" but no social work consult or coupon was provided. Admission note for readmit might say "patient has been eating canned soup" (diet failure).
3 Cardiology CHF → Renal (AKI) Index: CHF → Readmit: AKI 
(Gap ≤ 7 days) 1. Iatrogenic: Aggressive diuresis.
2. Monitoring: No 48h BMP scheduled.
3. Safety: "Triple Whammy" meds. Possibility: MD Progress Note might say "pushing Lasix to clear lungs" while the lab sheet shows Creatinine rising from 1.0 to 1.8. Discharge summary might fail to order a "renal function check" in 2 days.
4 Cardiology CHF → AMI (Demand) Index: CHF → Readmit: AMI 
(Gap ≤ 7 days) 1. Type 2 MI: Stress vs Thrombus.
2. Perfusion: Hypotension from diuresis.
3. Meds: Beta-Blocker held. Possibility: Readmit H&P might call it "NSTEMI likely demand-related due to volume overload." Index stay MAR might show Beta-Blocker was held for "soft BP" and never restarted, leaving the heart unprotected.
5 Cardiology AMI DAPT Failure Index: AMI → Readmit: Stent Clot 
(Gap ≤ 30 days) 1. Adherence: Missed DAPT doses.
2. Handoff: Script not filled.
3. Education: Risk not explained. Possibility: CM notes might state "script sent to pharmacy" but Pharmacy records show it was "returned to stock" or never picked up. Readmit note might say "patient stopped Plavix because of bruising."
6 Cardiology Post-PCI Bleed Index: PCI → Readmit: Bleed 
(Gap ≤ 3 days) 1. Site Care: Check q15m checks.
2. Vitals: Ignored hypotension.
3. Education: When to call. Possibility: Post-procedure nursing note might mention "small hematoma noted, pressure applied" but no re-check was documented before discharge. Patient might report "felt pop and wetness" at home.
7 Cardiology Post-MI Angina Index: AMI → Readmit: Angina 
(Gap ≤ 7 days) 1. Residual: Untreated stenosis.
2. Rate: HR > 80 at DC.
3. Activity: Pain with movement. Possibility: Cath report might say "70% OM lesion deferred for medical management." If readmit is for chest pain, it suggests medical management failed or was inadequate (e.g., low-dose meds).
8 Cardiology Arrhythmia Bounce Index: Afib → Readmit: Syncope 
(Gap ≤ 5 days) 1. Rate: HR < 110?
2. Ortho: BP drops standing?
3. Anticoag: Stroke risk managed? Possibility: Discharge vitals might show HR 115, but patient sent home anyway. Or, patient started on Sotalol/Beta-blocker without orthostatic BPs checked, leading to a fall at home.
9 Cardiology HTN Crisis Index: HTN → Readmit: Stroke 
(Gap ≤ 7 days) 1. Compliance: Side effects?
2. Titration: DC BP > 140/90?
3. Access: Cost issues? Possibility: Discharge vitals might show BP 160/95. MD note says "stable on current meds," but readmission for Hypertensive Urgency proves otherwise. Look for lack of titration in the MAR.
10 Pulmonology PNA Unstable Vitals Index: PNA → Readmit: Sepsis 
(Gap ≤ 5 days) 1. Fever: Masked by Tylenol?
2. Oxygen: Sat < 92% room air?
3. Meds: Oral tolerance? Possibility: Nursing flow sheet might show Tylenol given at 08:00 for "pain" (masking fever) and discharge at 10:00. O2 sat might be 91% on room air, but "home O2" was deemed unnecessary.
11 Pulmonology PNA Misdiagnosis Index: PNA → Readmit: CHF 
(Gap ≤ 5 days) 1. Dx: PNA vs CHF (BNP).
2. Meds: Diuretics held?
3. Imaging: CXR worsening? Possibility: Index CXR report might say "infiltrate vs edema." MD treated as PNA (antibiotics) and held Lasix. Readmit CXR shows "frank pulmonary edema," proving the first diagnosis was wrong or management caused the CHF.
12 Pulmonology COPD Action Plan Index: COPD → Readmit: COPD 
(Gap ≤ 15 days) 1. Plan: Written Green/Red zone?
2. Teach-back: Inhaler use?
3. Taper: Steroid rebound? Possibility: CM note says "education provided," but no "Action Plan" is scanned in the chart. Readmit note says "patient ran out of prednisone and breathing worsened," indicating a failed taper plan.
